A simple yet cool and intuitive Google maps widget for your website

== Description ==


### Simple Google Maps Widget

* [Simple Google Maps Widget](http://freedemo.ays-pro.com/)

The title is optional but good to have if you use multiple map widgets on your site. There is also a cool feature, where you can insert a snippet of information about the location of your choice in the widget and it'll show the snippet when you click on your map location marker.

Note that you should have a valid and one specific API key for each widget in order to get the map to work. But, don't worry, just follow the steps in [this article](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en)   to set up an API key for your map widget. Then, insert it into the API Key field in the widget and you have a working map widget with minimal steps.

The widget options are as follows:
- Title (Optional)
- API Key (Necessary)
- Location (Recommended)
- Latitude (optional)
- Longitude (optional)
- Marker Title (Necessary)

If you want to have a minimal but a good map widget with minimal but powerful options, then this widget is for you.
